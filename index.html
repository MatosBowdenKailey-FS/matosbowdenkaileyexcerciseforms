            The cat (<strong>Felis catus</strong>), commonly referred to as the
            domestic cat or house cat, is a small domesticated carnivorous
            mammal. It is the only domesticated species of the family Felidae.
            Recent advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the
            domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC.
            It is commonly kept as a house pet and farm cat, but also ranges
            freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. Valued by humans for
            companionship and its ability to kill vermin, the cat's retractable
            claws are adapted to killing small prey like mice and rats. It has a
            strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its
            night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social
            species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat
            communication includes vocalizations like meowing, purring,
            trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting as well as cat body
            language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for
            human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and
            perceives pheromones.

          <h2 id="etymology">Etymology</h2>
          <p>
            The origin of the English word cat, Old English catt, is thought to
            be the Late Latin word cattus, which was first used at the beginning
            of the 6th century.[4] The Late Latin word may be derived from an
            unidentified African language.[5] The Nubian word kaddîska 'wildcat'
            and Nobiin kadīs are possible sources or cognates.The forms might
            also have derived from an ancient Germanic word that was absorbed
            into Latin and then into Greek, Syriac, and Arabic.[7] The word may
            be derived from Germanic and Northern European languages, and
            ultimately be borrowed from Uralic, cf. Northern Sámi gáđfi, 'female
            stoat', and Hungarian hölgy, 'lady, female stoat'; from Proto-Uralic
            *käďwä, 'female (of a furred animal)'.[8] The English puss, extended
            as pussy and pussycat, is attested from the 16th century and may
            have been introduced from Dutch poes or from Low German puuskatte,
            related to Swedish kattepus, or Norwegian pus, pusekatt. Similar
            forms exist in Lithuanian puižė and Irish puisín or puiscín. The
            etymology of this word is unknown, but it may have arisen from a
            sound used to attract a cat.[9][10]

          <p>
            The scientific name Felis catus was proposed by Carl Linnaeus in
            1758 for a domestic cat.[1][2] Felis catus domesticus was proposed
            by Johann Christian Polycarp Erxleben in 1777.[3] Felis daemon
            proposed by Konstantin Satunin in 1904 was a black cat from the
            Transcaucasus, later identified as a domestic cat. In 2003, the
            International Commission on Zoological Nomenclature ruled that the
            domestic cat is a distinct species, namely Felis catus.[21][22] In
            2007, the modern domesticated subspecies F. silvestris catus sampled
            worldwide was considered to have likely descended from the African
            wildcat (F. lybica), following results of phylogenetic
            research.[23][24][a] In 2017, the IUCN Cat Classification Taskforce
            followed the recommendation of the ICZN in regarding the domestic
            cat as a distinct species, Felis catus.[25]

          <h2 id="evolution">Evolution</h2>
          <p>
            The domestic cat is a member of the Felidae, a family that had a
            common ancestor about 10 to 15 million years ago.[26] The
            evolutionary radiation of the Felidae began in Asia during the
            Miocene around 8.38 to 14.45 million years ago.[27] Analysis of
            mitochondrial DNA of all Felidae species indicates a radiation at
            6.46 to 16.76 million years ago.[28] The genus Felis genetically
            diverged from other Felidae around 6 to 7 million years ago.[27]
            Results of phylogenetic research shows that the wild members of this
            genus evolved through sympatric or parapatric speciation, whereas
            the domestic cat evolved through artificial selection.[29] The
            domestic cat and its closest wild ancestor are diploid and both
            possess 38 chromosomes[30] and roughly 20,000 genes.[31]

          <h2>Characteristics</h2>
          <p>
            Cats have many characteristics. Size, Skeleton and Skulls are just
            three characteristics of cats anatomy. They also have many senses.
          </p>
          <h3>Size</h3>
          <p>
            The domestic cat has a smaller skull and shorter bones than the
            European wildcat.[49] It averages about 46 cm (18 in) in
            head-to-body length and 23–25 cm (9.1–9.8 in) in height, with about
            30 cm (12 in) long tails. Males are larger than females.[50] Adult
            domestic cats typically weigh 4–5 kg (8.8–11.0 lb).[29]
          </p>
          <h3>Skeleton</h3>
          <p>
            Cats have seven cervical vertebrae (as do most mammals); 13 thoracic
            vertebrae (humans have 12); seven lumbar vertebrae (humans have
            five); three sacral vertebrae (as do most mammals, but humans have
            five); and a variable number of caudal vertebrae in the tail (humans
            have only three to five vestigial caudal vertebrae, fused into an
            internal coccyx).[51]: 11  The extra lumbar and thoracic vertebrae
            account for the cat's spinal mobility and flexibility. Attached to
            the spine are 13 ribs, the shoulder, and the pelvis.[51]: 16  Unlike
            human arms, cat forelimbs are attached to the shoulder by
            free-floating clavicle bones which allow them to pass their body
            through any space into which they can fit their head.[52]
          </p>
          <h3>Skull</h3>
          <p>
            The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye
            sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.[53]: 35  Within the jaw,
            cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it
            overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two
            long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's
            vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible
            paralysis and death.[54] Compared to other felines, domestic cats
            have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw,
            which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents,
            which have small vertebrae.[54]
          </p>
          <h3>Whiskers</h3>
          <p>
            The cat skull is unusual among mammals in having very large eye
            sockets and a powerful specialized jaw.[53]: 35  Within the jaw,
            cats have teeth adapted for killing prey and tearing meat. When it
            overpowers its prey, a cat delivers a lethal neck bite with its two
            long canine teeth, inserting them between two of the prey's
            vertebrae and severing its spinal cord, causing irreversible
            paralysis and death.[54] Compared to other felines, domestic cats
            have narrowly spaced canine teeth relative to the size of their jaw,
            which is an adaptation to their preferred prey of small rodents,
            which have small vertebrae.[54]
          </p>
          <h3>Behavior</h3>
          <p>
            Outdoor cats are active both day and night, although they tend to be
            slightly more active at night.[91] Domestic cats spend the majority
            of their time in the vicinity of their homes but can range many
            hundreds of meters from this central point. They establish
            territories that vary considerably in size, in one study ranging
            7–28 ha (17–69 acres).[92] The timing of cats' activity is quite
            flexible and varied but being low-light predators, they are
            generally crepuscular, which means they tend to be more active near
            dawn and dusk. However, house cats' behavior is also influenced by
            human activity and they may adapt to their owners' sleeping patterns
            to some extent.[93][94]
          </p>
          <h3>Sociability</h3>
          <p>
            The social behavior of the domestic cat ranges from widely dispersed
            individuals to feral cat colonies that gather around a food source,
            based on groups of co-operating females.[97][98] Within such groups,
            one cat is usually dominant over the others.[99] Each cat in a
            colony holds a distinct territory, with sexually active males having
            the largest territories, which are about 10 times larger than those
            of female cats and may overlap with several females' territories.
            These territories are marked by urine spraying, by rubbing objects
            at head height with secretions from facial glands, and by
            defecation.[82] Between these territories are neutral areas where
            cats watch and greet one another without territorial conflicts.
            Outside these neutral areas, territory holders usually chase away
            stranger cats, at first by staring, hissing, and growling, and, if
            that does not work, by short and violent, noisy attacks. Though cats
            do not have a social survival strategy or herd behavior, they always
            hunt alone.[100]

        <h2>Superstitions and Rituals</h2>
        <p>
          Many cultures have negative superstitions about cats. An example would
          be the belief that encountering a black cat ("crossing one's path")
          leads to bad luck, or that cats are witches' familiars used to augment
          a witch's powers and skills. The killing of cats in Medieval Ypres,
          Belgium, is commemorated in the innocuous present-day Kattenstoet (cat
          parade).[244] In mid-16th century France, cats would allegedly be
          burnt alive as a form of entertainment, particularly during midsummer
          festivals. According to Norman Davies, the assembled people "shrieked
          with laughter as the animals, howling with pain, were singed, roasted,
          and finally carbonized".[245] The remaining ashes were sometimes taken
          back home by the people for good luck.[246]
